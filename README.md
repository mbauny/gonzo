# What's this?

Gonzo is a static blog _engine_. This is probably a bit of an overstatement as Gonzo's only job is to organize Markdown files in a manner that suits me and so that they can be hosted on GitHub.

# Warning

Gonzo was implemented...

-   To be **highly opinionated**
-   To be **text and file oriented**
-   With absolutely **zero** consideration for esthetics
-   To take advantage of **GitHub**'s markdown facilities
-   To get rid of Jekyll
-   As **an experiment to get started with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)**
-   In just a few days

All this to say that you probably should not be using Gonzo for anything serious. Other than that, feel free to try it out :shrug:
