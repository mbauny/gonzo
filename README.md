# What's this?

Gonzo is a static blog *engine*. This is probably a bit of an overstatement as Gonzo's only job is to organize Markdown files in a manner that suits me and so that they can be hosted on GitHub.

# Disclaimer

Gonzo was implemented...
- To be **highly opinionated**
- To be **content oriented**
- With absolutely **zero** consideration for esthetics
- To take advantage of **GitHub**'s markdown facilities
- To get rid of Jekyll
- As **an experiment to get started with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)**. Total noob here
- In just a few days

All this to say that you probably should not be using Gonzo for anything serious. Other than that, feel free to try it out :shrug:
