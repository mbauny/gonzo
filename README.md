# A static blog engine for GitHub

_Blog engine_ is probably a bit of an overstatement: Gonzo will look for a folder named `posts` in a given directory and will then generate a couple of index pages referencing the Markdown files it found there. And that's about it! :shrug:

Check out [this repository](https://github.com/mbauny/blog) to see what the result looks like.

## :dart: Objectives

Gonzo was designed...

-   To be text and file oriented
    -   Zero configuration required
-   To support Markdown only
    -   This is the only markup language I can bear to write
    -   GitHub's rendering of Markdown content is pretty slick
-   With zero consideration for esthetics
    -   Content first
    -   No more endless struggle with Jekyll themes

## :construction: Toy project

Also keep in mind that Gonzo was implemented...

-   As a simple fun experiment
    -   This is absolutely not production ready
-   Very quickly
    -   In just a few days
    -   After work hours
-   To be extremely opinionated
    -   The project's name is a reference to [Gonzo journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism) which is written "without claims of objectivity"

All this to say that Gonzo is more a toy project than anything and that it should not be used for anything serious. Other than that, feel free to try it out :joystick:

## :clap: Credits

The original concept came from Josh Branchaud's [TIL repo](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til): He uses Markdown files for bite-size publications that are not worthy of a full blog post. I really liked the approach so I figured:

> Why not go all the way and host a complete blog on GitHub?

So... yeah, basically, I stole his idea... Thanks josh! :v:
